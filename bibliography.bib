  abstract = {In agricultural image analysis, optimal model performance is keenly pursued for better fulfilling visual recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, segmentation, object detection and localization), in the presence of challenges with biological variability and unstructured environments. Large-scale, balanced and ground-truthed image datasets are tremendously beneficial but most often difficult to obtain to fuel the development of highly performant models. As artificial intelligence through deep learning is impacting analysis and modeling of agricultural images, image augmentation plays a crucial role in boosting model performance while reducing manual efforts for image collection and labelling, by algorithmically creating and expanding datasets. Beyond traditional data augmentation techniques, generative adversarial network (GAN) invented in 2014 in the computer vision community, provides a suite of novel approaches that can learn good data representations and generate highly realistic samples. Since 2017, there has been a growth of research into GANs for image augmentation or synthesis in agriculture for improved model performance. This paper presents an overview of the evolution of GAN architectures followed by a first systematic review of various applications in agriculture and food systems (https://github.com/Derekabc/GANs-Agriculture), involving a diversity of visual recognition tasks for plant health conditions, weeds, fruits (preharvest), aquaculture, animal farming, plant phenotyping as well as postharvest detection of fruit defects. Challenges and opportunities of GANs are discussed for future research.}

  abstract = {Image denoising faces significant challenges, arising from the sources of noise. Specifically, Gaussian, impulse, salt, pepper, and speckle noise are complicated sources of noise in imaging. Convolutional neural network (CNN) has increasingly received attention in image denoising task. Several CNN methods for denoising images have been studied. These methods used different datasets for evaluation. In this paper, we offer an elaborate study on different CNN techniques used in image denoising. Different CNN methods for image denoising were categorized and analyzed. Popular datasets used for evaluating CNN image denoising methods were investigated. Several CNN image denoising papers were selected for review and analysis. Motivations and principles of CNN methods were outlined. Some state-of-the-arts CNN image denoising methods were depicted in graphical forms, while other methods were elaborately explained. We proposed a review of image denoising with CNN. Previous and recent papers on image denoising with CNN were selected. Potential challenges and directions for future research were equally fully explicated.},

               The purpose of this chapter is to provide information on the recent developments in perturbation theory. In recent years, there is a great increase of interest in the application of perturbation theory to the fundamental problems of quantum chemistry. Perturbation theory is designed to deal systematically with the effects of small perturbations on physical systems when the effects of the perturbations are mathematically too difficult to calculate exactly, and the properties of the unperturbed system are known. The new applications have been mainly to atoms where the reciprocal of the atomic number, l/Z, provides a natural perturbation parameter. These may be divided into two groups. The first consists of calculations of energy levels, and is a natural outgrowth of Hylleraas's classic work on the 1/Z expansion for two-electron atoms. The applications in the second group are to the calculation of expectation values and other properties of atoms and molecules, and are of much more recent origin. There are two principal reasons for the success of these new applications: (1) sufficient accuracy is frequently obtained from knowledge of a first-order perturbed wave function, and (2) a great advantage of perturbation theory is that the functional form of the perturbed wave function is shaped by the perturbation itself.}
