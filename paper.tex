\title{Title of the paper}


% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\maketitle


\begin{abstract}
  The abstract paragraph should be indented \nicefrac{1}{2}~inch (3~picas) on
  both the left- and right-hand margins. Use 10~point type, with a vertical
  spacing (leading) of 11~points.  The word \textbf{Abstract} must be centered,
  bold, and in point size 12. Two line spaces precede the abstract. The abstract
  must be limited to one paragraph.

\section{Introduction}
\textit{Introduce the idea of idempotent neural networks; give the definition. Justification for usefulness in applications where solutions can be both idempotent and not, and where the idempotent solution may be beneficial. Give a brief overview of the rest of the paper.}

\section{Method}
\textit{Outline the perturbation analysis which yielded the update rule. Jordan Normal form justification for looking at eigenvalues and for fixed-points. Stability analysis (and nice Julia heatmap) to argue that specific fixed-points are reached. Compare ordinary and modified autodiff by looking at derivative on a single-layer, non-bias network.}

\section{Experimental Results}
\textit{On experimental networks we give line graphs comparing absolute error at varying learning rates. We also give line graphs for LRs over many epochs. Takeaway message is that for deeper/wider networks we outperform ordinary autodiff by a lot.}

\textit{We replicate the results of IGN on MNIST and CelebA. Latent space analysis. Takeaway is that we show application to a U-net GAN architecture based on Conv layers.}

\section{Related Work}
\textit{Review Idempotent Generative Networks, contrasting our work on a gradient-free approach. Have others applied perturbation theory to ML? We suffer same problems as GANs: mode collapse.}

\section{Conclusion}
\textit{Give a conclusion of central idea: the use of perturbation analysis to find an iterator which we have successfully applied to a range of toy examples and GAN scenarios.}
